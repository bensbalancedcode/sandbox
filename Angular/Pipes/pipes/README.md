# Pipes

A little pipe game.

The plan so far:
simple 3x3 grid to start.
tile components with pictures on them that change as the state changes.
click to highlight and swap like in the old version.
maybe a green/yellow/red background.
tiles know what directions are allowed for the water to advance in.

How to do the clock?

A tile is a tile.component. It knows it's x and y coordinates.
